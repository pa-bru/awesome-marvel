A React Project in the Marvel universe.

```sh
$ npm run test:coverage
```

Then open the generated file with the command below

```sh
$ npm run test:coverage:open
```

- Redux - for the flux implementation
- Redux Thunk - for asynchronous calls
- Redux Dev Tools - a futuristic DX (developer experience) for redux
- Material UI - a react implementation of Google's Material Design
- React Router - for the routing
- React Helmet - to manage title and meta tag information
- React Swipeable Views - to add swipe interactions on mobile
- Jest & Enzyme for tests (Work In Progress)

- Add a server to secure private keys
- Use the new React suspense API to load elements together
- Use the new Context API.
